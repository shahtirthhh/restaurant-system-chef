2. **Manager Module**: Managers can view all orders, manage the menu, and update order statuses, notifying both customers and chefs.
3. **Chef Module**: Chefs can view and update the status of orders, notifying both managers and customers.
4. **Backend API**: Manages the database operations and real-time communication across all modules.

Together, these modules create an efficient and interactive restaurant management system.
